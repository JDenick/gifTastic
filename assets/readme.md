I almost have the gifTastic app completed. However, I am still missing
some styling as well as the correct function to pause / animate apps once 
the image has been clicked.

As you can see from my code, I tried working on the pause / animation function 
but for some reason couldn't get it to work. 

I suspect that it was to do with a syntax error. I believe that I am miss-coding the 
correct syntax within the object based off of what is coming up when I console log the 
results. 

I will keep trying but happy with what I have so far!
